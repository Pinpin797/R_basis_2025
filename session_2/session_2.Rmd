# Introduction

In the last session, we have gone through the basis of R.
Instead of continuing to learn more about R programming, in this session we are going to jump directly to rendering plots.

We make this choice for three reasons:

- Rendering nice plots is directly rewarding
- You will be able to apply what you learn in this session to your own data (given that they are *correctly formatted*)
- We will come back to R programming later, when you have all the necessary tools to visualize your results.


The objectives of this session will be to:

- Create basic plot with the `ggplot2` `library`
- Understand the `tibble` type
- Learn the different aesthetics in R plots
- Compose complex graphics

## Tidyverse

The `tidyverse` package is a collection of R packages designed for data science that include `ggplot2`.

All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures (plus the same shape of logo).

<center>
![](./img/tidyverse.jpg){width=500px}
</center>

`tidyverse` is a meta library, which can be long to install with the following command:
```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Luckily for you, `tidyverse` is preinstalled on your Rstudio server. So you just have to load the ` library`

```{R load_tidyverse}
library("tidyverse")
```
 
## Toy data set `mpg`

This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data that the EPA makes available on [fueleconomy.gov](http://fueleconomy.gov).
It contains only models which had a new release every year between 1999 and 2008.

You can use the `?` command to know more about this dataset.

```{r mpg_inspect, include=TRUE}
?mpg
```

But instead of using a dataset included in a R package, you may want to be able to use any dataset with the same format.
For that we are going to use the command `read_csv` which is able to read a [csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file.

This command also works for file URL

```{r mpg_download_local, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, echo = F, include=F}
new_mpg <- read_csv("./mpg.csv")
```

```{r mpg_download, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval = F}
new_mpg <- read_csv(
  "https://can.gitbiopages.ens-lyon.fr/R_basis/session_2/mpg.csv"
)
```

You can check the number of lines and columns of the data with `dim`:

```{r mpg_inspect2, include=TRUE}
dim(new_mpg)
```

To visualize the data in Rstudio you can use the command. `View`

```R
View(new_mpg)
```

Or by simply calling the variable.
Like for simple data type calling a variable print it.
But complex data type like `new_mpg` can use complex print function.

```{r mpg_inspect3, include=TRUE}
new_mpg
```

Here we can see that `new_mpg` is a `tibble` we will come back to `tibble` later.


## New script

Like in the last session, instead of typing your commands directly in the console, you are going to write them in an R script.

![](./img/formationR_session2_scriptR.png)

# First plot with `ggplot2`

We are going to make the simplest plot possible to study the relationship between two variables: the scatterplot.

The following command generates a plot between engine size `displ` and fuel efficiency `hwy` present the `new_mpg` `tibble`.

```{r new_mpg_plot_a, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

<div class="pencadre">
Are cars with bigger engines less fuel efficient ? 
</div>

`ggplot2` is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/ref=as_li_ss_tl). You provide the data, tell `ggplot2` how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

- you begin a plot with the function `ggplot()`
- you complete your graph by adding one or more layers
- `geom_point()` adds a layer with a scatterplot
- each **geom **function in `ggplot2` takes a `mapping` argument
- the `mapping` argument is always paired with `aes()`

<div class="pencadre">
What happend when you use only the command `ggplot(data = mpg)` ?
</div>

```{r only_ggplot, cache = TRUE, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=2}
ggplot(data = new_mpg)

# Aesthetic mappings

`ggplot2` will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic (here a unique color) to each unique value of the variable, a process known as scaling. `ggplot2` will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values.

Try the following aesthetic:

- `size`
- `alpha`
- `shape`

## `color` mapping

```{r new_mpg_plot_e, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```


## `size` mapping

```{r new_mpg_plot_f, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## `alpha` mapping

```{r new_mpg_plot_g, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## `shape` mapping

```{r new_mpg_plot_h, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

You can also set the aesthetic properties of your **geom** manually. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue and squares:

```{r new_mpg_plot_i, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", shape=0)
```

Here is a list of different shapes available in R:
<center>
![](./img/shapes.png){width=300px}
</center>
 
<div class="pencadre">
What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
</div>

```{r new_mpg_plot_not_blue, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue")) + 
  geom_point()
```

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>
```{r new_mpg_plot_blue, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue")
```
</p>
</details>
 
## Mapping a **continuous** variable to a color.

You can also map continuous variable to a color

```{r continu, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + 
  geom_point()
```

<div class="pencadre">
What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `color = displ < 5`?
</div>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>
```{r condiColor, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5)) + 
  geom_point()
```
</p>
</details>
 
# Facets

You can create multiple plots at once by faceting. For this you can use the command `facet_wrap`.
This command takes a formula as input.
We will come back to formulas in R later, for now, you have to know that formulas start with a `~` symbol.

To make a scatterplot of `displ` versus `hwy` per car `class` you can use the following code:

```{r new_mpg_plot_k, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~class, nrow = 2)
```

<div class="pencadre">
Now try to facet your plot by `fuel + class`
</div>


<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>
Formulas allow you to express complex relationship between variables in R !

```{r new_mpg_plot_l, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ fuel + class, nrow = 2)
```
</p>
</details>

# Composition

There are different ways to represent the information :

```{r new_mpg_plot_o, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

 \ 

```{r new_mpg_plot_p, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

 \ 

We can add as many layers as we want

```{r new_mpg_plot_q, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

 \

We can make `mapping` layer specific

```{r new_mpg_plot_s, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

 \ 

We can use different `data` (here new_mpg and mpg tables) for different layers (you will lean more on `filter()` later)

```{r new_mpg_plot_t, cache = TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"))
```

# To go further: publication ready plots

Once you have created the graph you need for your publication, you have to save it.
You can do it with the `ggsave` function.

First save your plot in a variable :

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
      geom_point()
```

Then save it in the wanted format:

```{r, eval=F}
ggsave("test_plot_1.png", p1, width = 12, height = 8, units = "cm")
```

```{r, eval=F}
ggsave("test_plot_1.pdf", p1, width = 12, height = 8, units = "cm")
```

You may also change the appearance of your plot by adding a `theme` layer to your plot:

```{r,fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, message=FALSE}
p1 + theme_bw()
```

```{r,fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, message=FALSE}
p1 + theme_minimal()
```

You may have to combine several plots, for that you can use the `cowplot` package which is a `ggplot2` extension.
First install it :


```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("cowplot")
```

```{r, include=F, echo =F}
if (! require("cowplot")) {
  install.packages("cowplot")
}
```

Then you can use the function `plot` grid to combine plots in a publication ready style:

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(cowplot)
```

```{r,fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, message=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(data = new_mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
p1
```


```{r,fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, message=FALSE}
p2 <- ggplot(data = new_mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
p2
```


```{r,fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, message=FALSE}
plot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c('A', 'B'), label_size = 12)
```

You can also save it in a file.

```{r, eval=F}
p_final = plot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c('A', 'B'), label_size = 12)
ggsave("test_plot_1_and_2.png", p_final, width = 20, height = 8, units = "cm")
```

You can learn more features about `cowplot` on [https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/introduction.html](its website). 

<div class="pencadre">
Use the `cowplot` documentation to reproduce this plot and save it.

  geom_point() + theme_bw()

p_row <- plot_grid(p1 + theme(legend.position = "none"), p2 + theme(legend.position = "none"), labels = c('A', 'B'), label_size = 12)
p_legend <- get_legend(p1 + theme(legend.position = "top"))

plot_grid(p_row, p_legend, nrow = 2, rel_heights = c(1,0.2))
```

p_legend <- get_legend(p1 + theme(legend.position = "top"))

p_final <- plot_grid(p_row, p_legend, nrow = 2, rel_heights = c(1,0.2))
p_final
```

```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = F}
ggsave("plot_1_2_and_legend.png", p_final, width = 20, height = 8, units = "cm")
```

There are a lot of other available `ggplot2` extensions which can be useful (and also beautiful).
You can take a look at them here: [https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/]( ggplot2 gallery)
