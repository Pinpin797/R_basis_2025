# R formation

## Session 1
Introduction to R and RStudio
- R introduction
- RStudio interface
- numerical operation
- data structure
- functions
- R packages
- Examples

## Session 2
Introduction to tidyverse
In this session we play-back the steps of the creation of an Exel table 

- numerical variable creation
- numerical operations
- string creation
- variable concatenation and variable type: paste0, typeof
- vector : lenght, head, summary
- data.frame : dim, ncol, nrow
- matrix
- list

## session 2
In this session we extract the list of differentially expressed genes from a
DESeq2 .csv output. We then extract only the up-regulated and down-regulated
genes.

- load a table: read.table, read.csv
- columns selection : boolean vector
- lines selection : boolean vector
- write a .csv and .Rdata file
- path, working-directory, and .Rhistory file

## session 3
In this session we counts the nucleotides in a sequences

- load .Rdata object with the sequence
- transformation between vector and string : split
- loop
- simple conditional testing : if else
- code wrapping within function
- script

## session n
Conversion of a fasta file into a GTF file
- list as hashing table
- regexp

## session n+1
Converting a nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence
- load codon to AA table
- build conversion function between codon and AA
- build conversion function for a sequence function 
- use list as hashing table
