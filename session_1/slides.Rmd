RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the current line, you can

- click on the Run button above the editor panel, or
- select “Run Lines” from the “Code” menu, or
- hit Ctrl+Return in Windows or Linux or ⌘+Return on OS X. To run a block of code, select it and then Run. 

If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run, there is no need to reselect the section and Run, you can use the next button along, Re-run the previous region. This will run the previous code block including the modifications you have made.
