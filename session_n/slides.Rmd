## R Markdown

R Markdown provides an unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results, and your prose commentary. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more.

You need the `rmarkdown` package, but you don’t need to explicitly install it or load it, as RStudio automatically does both when needed.


```{r logical_operator, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/rmarkdownflow.png')
```

## R Markdown

R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

- For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.
- For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them ( i.e. the code).
- As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.

## Markdown language
Text formatting

`*italic*`  or `_italic_`

- *italic*  or _italic_

`**bold**`   `__bold__`

- **bold**   __bold__

`` `code` ``

- `code`

`superscript^2^` and `subscript~2~`

- superscript^2^ and subscript~2~

## Markdown language

Headings
```
# 1st Level Header

## 2nd Level Header

### 3rd Level Header
```

## Markdown language
Lists

```
*   Bulleted list item 1
*   Item 2
    * Item 2a
    * Item 2b

1.  Numbered list item 1
1.  Item 2. The numbers are incremented automatically in the
    output.
```

## Markdown language
Links and images

```
<http://example.com>

[linked phrase](http://example.com)

![optional caption text](path/to/img.png)
```

## Markdown language
Tables 

```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

## Rmarkdown: markdown meet R

**R code will be evaluated and printed**

```` ```{r} ````
```{r}`r ''`
summary(cars$dist)
```
```` ``` ````


```{r}
summary(cars$dist)
```

## Rmarkdown: markdown meet R

**Inline R Code**

There were `` `r ``  `nrow(cars)` `` ` `` cars studied

There were `r nrow(cars)` cars studied

When inserting numbers into text use `format()`

## Chunk options

Chunk output can be customised with options, arguments supplied to chunk header. Knitr provides almost 60 options that you can use to customize your code chunks.

Option             | Run code | Show code | Output | Plots | Messages | Warnings 
-------------------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|----------|---------
`eval = FALSE`     | -        |           | -      | -     | -        | -
`include = FALSE`  |          | -         | -      | -     | -        | -
`echo = FALSE`     |          | -         |        |       |          |
`results = "hide"` |          |           | -      |       |          | 
`fig.show = "hide"`|          |           |        | -     |          |
`message = FALSE`  |          |           |        |       | -        |
`warning = FALSE`  |          |           |        |       |          | -

## Rmarkdown: `kable`

The tables syntax is tedious to use...

```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

\pause

do it in R !

```` ```{r kable} ````
```{r}`r ''`
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:5, 1:5], 
  caption = "A knitr kable."
)
```
```` ``` ````

## Rmarkdown: `kable`

do it in R !

```{r kable}
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:5, 1:5], 
  caption = "A knitr kable."
)
```

## Caching

Each knit of a document starts from a completely clean slate.

- This is great for reproducibility
- ensures that you’ve captured every important computation in code.
- can be painful if you have some computations that take a long time

The solution is `cache = TRUE`

## Caching

```` ```{r raw_data} ````
```{r}`r ''`
rawdata <- readr::read_csv("a_very_large_file.csv")
```
```` ``` ````

```` ```{r processed_data, cache = TRUE, dependson = "raw_data"} ````
```{r}`r ''`
processed_data <- rawdata %>% 
  filter(!is.na(import_var)) %>% 
  mutate(new_variable = complicated_transformation(x, y, z))
```
```` ``` ````

## YAML Header

You can control many “whole document” settings by tweaking the parameters of the YAML header

## Bibliographies and Citations

Pandoc can automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles.

```
bibliography: rmarkdown.bib
```

You can change the style of your citations and bibliography by referencing a CSL (citation style language) file in the csl field:

```
bibliography: rmarkdown.bib
csl: apa.csl
```

## Bibliographies and Citations

User the bibtex key:
```
Blah blah [@smith04].
```

Separate multiple citations with a `;`:
```
Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].
```

You can add arbitrary comments inside the square brackets: 
```
Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].
```

Remove the square brackets to create an in-text citation:
```
says blah, or @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.
```

Add a `-` before the citation to suppress the author's name: 
```
Smith says blah [-@smith04].
```

## Rmarkdown is not just for R


```` ```{bash} ````
```
ls -l

```` ``` ````

```{bash}
ls -l
```

## Rmarkdown is not just for R

```` ```{python} ````
```
x = 1 ** 4
print(x)
```
```` ``` ````

```{python}
x = 10 ** 4
print(x)
```
